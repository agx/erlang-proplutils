Some proplist helpers
=====================

Delete all properties named foo or bar:
	
        1> proplutils:delete([foo, bar], [{foo, "does"}, {bar, "not"}, {baz, "matter"}]).       
        [{baz,"matter"}]

Delete all properties that aren't named foo or bar:

        1> proplutils:delete_except([foo, bar], [{foo, "does"}, {bar, "not"}, {baz, "matter"}]).
        [{foo,"does"},{bar,"not"}]
